            <h3>More about me...</h3>
            <p>Another important aspect of who I am is my faith. I am a Christian. I believe that I have been called to serve God wherever I find myself. I see my faith journey as an adventure, in which I get to seek out the path that God has for me in this world. I believe I am continually growing in my understanding of who God is and who He has created me to be â€“ and therefore I know I have not arrived at any kind of destination, regarding my faith, but am in a continual process of growth of character and discovery â€“ till the day I die.</p>
